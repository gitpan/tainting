NAME
    tainting - Enable taint mode lexically

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    To enable tainting in a lexical block:

     {
         use tainting;
         # tainting is enabled
     }
     # tainting is disabled again

    To disable tainting in a lexical block:

     use tainting;
     {
         no tainting;
         # tainting is disabled
     }
     # tainting is enabled again

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simpler interface to Taint::Runtime. The idea is
    so that there is no functions or variables to import. Just "use" or
    "no", like warnings or strict. Tainting of %ENV will be done one time
    automatically the first time this module is used.

    Please (PLEASE) read Taint::Runtime's documentation first about the
    pro's and con's of enabling/disabling tainting at runtime. TL;DR: Use -T
    if you can.
